Changes from v1.0 beta release to v2.0 deployment:\
  -Changed rating model to track user's full name rather than ID to make viewing ratings more intuitive to instructors\
  -Added 'Settings' page for users to edit their information\
  -Added a grade for each user and displays that grade. If the user does not have a grade then it displays that they have not been assigned one\
  -Admins, even with a group assigned, won't display the group members with rating options
